Unit Test for NEMSIOGFS library
#Abstract: The nemsiogfs library is such a specific library to describe all GFS
#   variables in nemsio format. The unit test of it requires read and write
#   all of these variables. Therefore, we simply the global chgres code into
#   a test code to fullfill this process.
#   This script changes the resolution of the GFS files. We provide the T126
#   low resolution data as the testdataset. It changes to the high resolution
#   T574 inorder to test its function for use in high resolution.
#   *****Notice*****
#   The compile of the code need support of other libraries, since the test of
#   all GFS variables is a systematic work. The setting of these library (nemsio,
#   BACIO, sigio etc...) may varies based on specific machine. Setting of variables 
#   Also affect the results. 

Unit test directory contains separate tests with associtaed parts

Testing nesmiogfs v2.2.0 builds:
To test your builds by available unit tests:
1. cd ../unit_test/
  ./build_code.sh cray       :for cray machine
  ./build_code.sh wcoss      :for phase 1&2
  ./build_code.sh theia      :for theia
===   This is to compile the test code.

2. cd ../unit_test/
   ./test.sh        :for WCOSS and Theia
===   This to run the test
   cat ./run_cray.sh  | bsub         :for cray 
3. The result will be shown as
gfsout:  the nemsio format data at rsolution of T574
The support data: e.g. orography etc on machine may also affect the result. Following just use the common setting based on available datasets on each machine.
The size is 1544778184 bits for WCOSS and Theia based on idrt=0, bin=4 (default). export CHGRESVARS="use_ufo=.true.,IALB=0,ntrac=3,idvc=2,idvt=21,idsl=1,IDVM=0,OUTTYP=1,GRDFMT='bin4'"
The size is 1035161800 bits for CRAY based on idrt=4, based on 'export CHGRESVARS=${CHGRESVARS}'. 
You can also check the running record to see the process.
